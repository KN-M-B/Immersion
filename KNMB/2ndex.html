        <p>
          The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster
          for the human race. They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of
          those of us who live in “advanced” countries, but they have
          destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected
          human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological
          suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have
          inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued
          development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly
          subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict greater damage
          on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social
          disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased
          physical suffering even in “advanced” countries.

          Arknights is a mobile tower defense (TD) game developed by Hypergryph,
          originally released in mainland China (CN) on May 1, 2019, before
          received a release in Japan, Korea, North America, Europe, and
          Southeast Asia (collectively known as Global) by Yostar on January 16,
          2020, and in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau (TW) by Longcheng on June
          29, 2020.
          <br />
          <br />
          While it first appears to be a deceptively simple TD, Arknights is
          usually more difficult than the run-of-the-mill TD game due to tricky
          maps and enemy design, and provides challenging combat puzzles. A
          strong aspect of the game is the management of the player's Operators
          and correct use of their abilities to achieve victory. Arknights also
          features the important base building feature.
          <br />
          <br />
          Arknights utilizes a gacha system for players to obtain the Operators,
          however, the game designs stages to be solvable using Operators of the
          most common rarities. Additionally, the Recruitment system permits the
          free, albeit rare acquisition of most of the oldest high rarity
          Operators.
          <br />
          <br />
          Due to the differing release dates and other factors, the Global
          server of Arknights is ~6 months behind the CN server while the TW
          server is ~8 months behind CN and ~3 months behind Global.

          Ado (Japanese: アド, born October 24, 2002) is a female utaite who
          began her activities on January 10, 2017 at the age of 14. In late
          2020, she exploded onto the music scene with her debut release of
          "USSEEWA" at just 17 years old. As of March 2024, it has over 320
          million views on YouTube, and over 6.7 million plays with over
          twenty-seven thousand mylists on Niconico. It also peaked at number 1
          on Billboard Japan Hot 100, Oricon Digital Singles Chart, and the
          Oricon Streaming Chart. The song reached 100 million plays on
          Billboard Japan after 17 weeks from charting-in, which was the sixth
          fastest in history and the youngest for a solo singer. Since then, Ado
          has been garnering lots of attention when releasing new covers or
          original music and she also releases albums of her covered songs as
          well.
          <br />
          <br />
          From the release of big-hit singles like "Show 唱" to the globe
          trotting "Uta no Uta" One Piece: Film RED soundtrack/album, Ado has
          only risen since her smash hit "USSEEWA". In 2022, her song, "New
          Genesis", was used as the theme song for the anime film One Piece
          Film: Red, and topped Apple Music's Global Top 100 charts.

          <br />
          <br />
          Ado has a versatile voice and is able to add power to it. Her vocals,
          seeming somewhat mature for her age, usually give off an angsty vibe,
          as of a rebellious teenager especially in some of her original and
          cover songs like "Readymade" and "Crime & Punishment," where she best
          utilizes it.
